The project is centered around the implementation of a sophisticated predictive model, specifically a random forest regressor, to forecast the prices of five distinct commodities in real-time. This predictive model enables the generation of future price predictions for each commodity, forecasting trends for one week into the future from the current date.
In terms of its technical infrastructure, the project is structured around three main components: two servers and one client. The client serves as the interface through which commodity signals are transmitted to server 1. This server is responsible for processing these signals and generating corresponding predictions for each commodity.
Upon receiving the predictions, the client evaluates them alongside a 7-day rolling sum, a technique commonly used in financial analysis to assess trends over time. Based on this analysis, the client makes informed decisions regarding buying or selling actions for each commodity.
Following the decision-making process, the client then communicates the buy/sell signals back to server 2. This server functions as the hub for managing the order book, recording and executing the trading actions determined by the client's decisions.
Overall, the project's architecture is designed to facilitate the seamless flow of information and actions between the client and servers, enabling efficient real-time prediction and trading of commodities based on advanced forecasting techniques.
